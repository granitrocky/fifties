A video game about a zombie apocalypse 
that only affects men so it's up to 
the housewives of 50's America to save 
humanity.

Plot
====

In 1953 a certain laboratory in an undisclosed
location developed a serum that could genetically
improve humans, giving them enhanced speed,
agility, strength, and brainpower.

Scientists found a way to modify the serum such
that it could only activate itself in the presence of a
Y chromosome, thus isolating the effects to men -
mostly because of female discrimination at the
time.

The serum was a success, and sales skyrocketed
just a few weeks after its release.

What the creators did not anticipate, though,
was the human body's incapacity to handle the
serum. The mental and physical over-exhaustion
triggered a mental decay which started out slow, but
sped up exponentially within a few months after
usage of the serum. The brains of the users were left
with only the most basic survival reflexes,
transforming the users into strong, fast, agile,
emotionless shells of humans, devouring any life form
in their path.

Bites from the affected individuals could place
copies of the rogue serum into the bodies of the
bitten, giving them the symptoms. Shortly after, the
serum evolved into a more powerful variant, causing
mental decay in just days. No one was safe. No
one...

except the women.

She puts on her best dress, a string of pearls, does her hair taking
out the curlers, puts on her most stylish flats, and the finishing touch:
lipstick the blood of her enemies.
